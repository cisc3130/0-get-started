# Homework 0: Getting started with Github and Travis CI

This assignments walks you through the mechanics of cloning a repository, making changes, and submitting your changes as a pull request.

*This workflow may take getting used to. This is your chance to work through it. Start immediately and come to office hours if you can't get it to work.*

1. *Accept this assignment on Github Classroom.* Follow the link from the [class schedule](www.sci.brooklyn.cuny.edu/~levitan/data-structures/schedule.html) and follow Github's instructions from there. If you don't have a Github account, create one now.

2. Follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/cisc3130/docs/blob/master/travis.md) to integrate your repository with Travis CI for automatic testing.

2. Follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/cisc3130/docs/blob/master/submissions.md). When you are up to the __Modify__ section ("Edit the project files to fulfill the assignment requirements"), write a short program called helloworld.cpp (naming must be exactly the same) to print the phrase "Hello world" to the terminal. Continue with the rest of the submission instructions.

3. You will follow this workflow (accepting assignments, enabling travis, modifying and submitting) for all assignments in this class.
